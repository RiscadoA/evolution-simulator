      This project aims to simulate the evolution of a population of creatures, with customizable restraints.
      Each creature is represented by a circle, while each unit of food is represented by a tiny circle.
      The goal of the creatures is to eat as much food as possible before the time runs out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each round, the creatures that perform the best will reproduce, and the rest will die. With each reproduction,
      the new creatures will have a chance to mutate. You can change all of the parameters of the simulation by
      clicking on the settings button.

      For more info you can click the "?" button in the top right corner.

    Evolution settings
    <hr>
    <p>
      Here you can set the size of the population in each generation and the mutation rate of genes.
      If the mutation rate is too low, evolution will be slow, and if it is too high, the creatures will
      be too random, and any good traits can easily be lost.

      Here you can set the number of eyes of each creature, which will be used to determine the direction of the nearest
      food unit. You can also set the range of the number of extra neurons and connections in the neural network.

      Here you can set the number of food units that will be generated at the beginning of each round. You can also
      how much food units will be generated by unit of time and how long the round will last.
